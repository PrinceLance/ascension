### Bidding for a House

In order to maximise the number of people playing as the house of their choice, we are following a bidding procedure:

1. The Game Master will open up a Thread on Facebook with all players. 
2. Each Player announces which House they wish to take.
3. If the House of your choice is uncontested after all 12 players have mentioned their preference, or 24 hours have past. You claim that House.
4. If however a House is contested, the claimants will bid against each other to win the House
    1. You bid with the % of points you're willing to give up from the first episode. So if you bid '10' and win the House, it means you will only receive 90% of the points awarded for the first episode.
    2. If you bid over 100%, overages are deducted from subsequent episodes. So 250% means you don't score any points for the first two episodes and onlf half for the third episode.... really, don't enter a bidding war.
    3. If you lose a contested house, you can pick an unclaimed House - first come, first serve.
    4. The bidding process will run until everyone has picked a House, or 36 hours, whichever comes first.
    5. If a player fails to indicate their interest within 24 hours, they are randomly assigned an unclaimed House by the Game Master. This is to unsure that the other players can proceed to the bidding round for contested Houses.
5. The Game Master registers your House in the Game.
