# Ascension II : Crossed Banners

The fog of war descends on Westeros...

## Game Summary

Ascension is an online text-based game played alongside season 6 of HBO's Game of Thrones. You play by selecting your favourite characters, and having them compete in award categories of _wit_, _damage_, _jockey_, _style_ and _support_. Points are awarded by fellow players whom cast votes each episode.

It is similar to fantasy football, as you build up a roster of characters at the start of the season, and get points for their performance in each episode.

In keeping with the Game of Thrones logic, you can also send your characters on diplomatic and murder missions; gathering intelligence or taking out characters from other player's rosters. But be careful! Failed attempts leave you exposed! Plot at your own peril...

## Quick Start

1. **Sign Up**. [Sign up](http://goo.gl/forms/PyqkSGGuBa)
2. **Pick a House**. [Houses](#houses) boost the characters you pick from that house, have special abilities, and are public knowledge.
3. **Pick 7 Characters for your Roster**. Every episode your [characters](#characters) will compete for points in the **[award categories](#award-categories)** (wit, damage, jockey, style and support). Players all **[vote](#popular-vote)** for the characters who are most deserving of points in each category, so pick your characters wisely. Rosters are secret. [Follow a strategy](#Picking-Your-Characters).
4. **Watch the Weekly Episode**. Watch the episode within a week of it being aired.
5. **Cast your Weekly Votes**. For each of the award categories, vote who most deserves the award that week. Votes are public.
6. **Initiate Weekly Missions**. Send one of your characters to gather intel, and/or assasinate characters from another roster. **[Missions](#missions)** are secret.
7. **Consult the Chronicles**. A chronicle is sent out to all players with the voting record, and the results from the spy and murder missions, some private, some public.
8. **Rank on the Leaderboard**. Leaderboard is updated with the weekly character points.

## Rules

The game is played in a league of 12 players. Each player represents a **[House](#houses)** and fields a **[Roster](#character-roster)** of 7 GoT Characters. **[Characters](#characters)** are used to score points across 5 **[Award Categories](#award-categories)**. Points are awarded based on **[Popular Vote](#popular-vote)** after each episode. The player with the most points at the end of the season ascends to the throne.

### Character Roster

A Character Roster is a list of GoT characters a player fields for the entire game. Players may freely and secretly pick 7 **[Characters](#characters)** to form their roster before the season starts. Players can pick the same characters. Though players represent a unique House, they **are not** restricted to fielding characters from that house. Characters belonging to their House gain scoring bonuses, but they also make those characters more obvious targets for assassinations. 

### Award Categories

During each episodes, characters with vie for point in the following award categories:

* **Wit** - smartest or most piercing delivery of a line.
* **Damage** - physical and mental destruction, dealt or received.
* **Jockey** - most promising manoeuvring for the Iron Throne. 
* **Style** - best look, appearance or use of props.  
* **Support** - most helpful supporting character.

### Houses

All 12 available houses are unique and will have your roster extra flavour with their [abilities](#house-abilities) & [bonuses](#house-bonuses). _Abilities_ change the mechanics of the game, while _bonuses_ change how strongly members of that house score in particular award categories.

#### Available Houses 

* House Bolton
* Council of Meereen
* House Arryn
* House Greyjoy
* House Martell
* Independents
* Night's Watch & Free Folk
* League of Minor Orders
* House Targaryen & Dothraki Horde
* House Tyrell
* House Lannister
* House Stark

Of special note are **Council of Meereen**, which consist of the formidable characters who remained to rule Meereen at the close of season 5; **House Arryn**, which might as well be House Baelish; **Independents** which gather the many mystics, magicians and maniacs of both continents; **Night's Watch & Free Folk** which have formed an unholy alliance; **League of Minor Orders** which gather nobility and clergy from the Order of the Sparrows, Slave traders from Essos, Lords of the House Frey and Ser Davos Seaworth; **House Tyrell** which includes their sworn bannerman from House Tarly; and **House Targaryen & Dothraki Horde** which contain many of the yet-to-be-introduced characters.

#### House Abilities

Each house has a special ability which allows you to make strategic use of your House's strengths. Be sure to consult the other houses' abilities as well .. some may affect you more than your own...

Depending on the `type`, the abilities the way prominence, diplomacy, violence and missions work for that House. These are the interactive components of the game and are explained below. The modifications are detailed in the `grants` column, and the characters listed under `immunity` are impervious to damage from an attack. You can bet on that house fielding that character, though attacking them is of no use as they wouldn't take any damage.

#### House Bonuses 

Bonus multipliers reveal the strength and advantages a House has over the others. They are applied to the respective award scores of any of the characters on a player's roster. The bonus multipliers are distributed as follows:

| House | wit | damage | jockey | style | support |
|:-----:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| House Bolton | - | 10 | - | - | 10 |
| Council of Meereen | 20 | - | - | - | - |
| House Arryn | - | - | 20 | - | - |
| House Greyjoy | - | 20 | - | - | - |
| House Martell | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 |
| Independents | - | - | - | 10 | 10 |
| Night's Watch & Free Folk | - | 10 | - | - | 10 |
| League of Minor Orders | - | - | - | - | - |
| House Targaryen & Dothraki Horde | - | 10 | 10 | - | - |
| House Tyrell | - | - | - | 20 | - |
| House Lannister | 10 | - | 10 | - | - |
| House Stark | - | - | - | - | 20 |

For example, if Player A has House Bolton, and Player B has House Stark, if Sansa Stark is on both their rosters, and scores 100 points in the Damage category - pending any further modification by health, missions, house abilities - Player A would apply its 10% bonus  and be awarded 110 points, whereas Player B would not have any House Bonus and be awarded 100 points.

#### Bidding for a House

In order to maximise the number of people who are playing the house of their choice, we are following a bidding procedure:

1. The Game Master will open up a Thread on Facebook with all players. 
2. Each Player announces which House they wish to take.
3. If the House of your choice is uncontested after all 12 players have mentioned their preference, or 24 hours have past. You claim that House.
4. If however a House is contested, the claimants will bid against each other to win the House
    1. You bid with %penalty on your score for the first episode. so if you bid '10' and win the House, it means you will only receive 90% of the points awarded for the first episode.
    2. If you bid over 100%, overages are deducted from subsequent episodes. So 250% means you don't score any points for the first two episodes and onlf half for the third episode.... really, don't enter a bidding war.
    3. If you lose a contested house, you can pick an unclaimed House - first come, first serve.
    4. The bidding process will run until everyone has picked a House, or 36 hours, whichever comes first.
    5. If a player fails to indicate their interest within 24 hours, they are randomly assigned an unclaimed House by the Game Master. This is to unsure that the other players can proceed to the bidding round for contested Houses.5
5. The Game Master registers your House in the Game.


### Characters

Other than their ability to bring in points in each of the award categories, each character has four main traits which defines their role and value in the game.

* **House**, affiliation with a major or minor house, a cult, guild or the independents.
* **Prominence**, how central they are to Game of Thrones.
* **Violence**, how deadly they are.
* **Diplomacy**, how good they are at gathering intelligence

**IMPORTANT : Prominence determines the score multiplier for the character** - The higher the prominence, the lower the multiplier. See [Prominence Multiplier](#prominence-multiplier) for details. 

#### Available Characters

All 88 available characters have an [affiliation & powers](https://github.com/tijptjik/ascension/blob/gh-pages/S06/character.powers.csv) and have a [bios](https://github.com/tijptjik/ascension/blob/gh-pages/S06/character.bio.csv) to remind you who they are.


### Missions

Missions are at the heart of player interactivity in _Ascension II : Crossed Banners_. This is where _Crossed Banners_ and regular fantasy leagues diverge. Besides the regular voting, you can also send two of your characters on missions after each episode.

The objective of missions is to eliminate characters from other player's rosters. You achieve this by sending one of your characters to assisinate a specific character from a specific opponent's roster. The challenge is that, because rosters are secret, you will need to run intelligence missions under the guise of diplomacy to learn enough about other rosters to effectively take out characters. It's similar to the game of [Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) but instead of colour codes you get intel on the roster's affiliations, promincence, violence and diplomacatic power.

* Sending a character on a mission, gives them a performance penalty for that episode. The percentage depends on their Diplomacy/Violence Power.
* Characters sent on missions typically cannot be killed, only wounded. Characters with Violence Power 5 kill character whether they are on a mission or not. 

##### Diplomacy : Gathering Intelligence

For slaughter to be somewhat effective, it needs to be somewhat discriminate. You thus have diplomatatic missions at your disposal to gather intelligence on another player's roster. At the outset all rosters but your own are secret, but through whatever means available you can 

Example of General is : 'There are more Starks than Lannisters, both at least one'
Example of Targetted is : 'This character has more diplomacy than prominence, but less damage than both'

* Rosters are secret, intelligence is... but doesn't have to be. You may form informal allegiances with other players, and coordinate diplomatic missions and share the intel between you.

| power | intel target | intel count       | performance penalty|
|:-----:|:------------:|:-----------------:|:------------------:|
| 1     | roster       | 1                 | 0%                 |
| 2     | roster       | 2                 | 25%                |
| 3     | roster       | 3                 | 50%                |
| 4     | character    | 1                 | 0%                 |
| 5     | character    | 2                 | 25%                |

##### Violence : Attempting Assassinations

Once you've cleared sufficient doubt which House has a particular character you'd want to damage, you can send in one of your assassins to take them out. The purpose of killing off characters is to prevent them from scoring any more points for their house - or simply out of spite. 

* Each week you're given a single opportunity to order _one_ of your characters to attempt to kill another player's character. 
* You send them on a mission by selecting the target House, and the target Character.
* You'll only be presented with Characters which have been fielded in at least one roster for the game.
* Attempts can be either succesful or fail.
* **Succesful** attempt

* Damage is _not_ commulative. So if you deal 50% damage in one round, running the same assassination attempt will not kill the player. You'd need to send a lethal assassin

* Certain House / Character combinsations grant them immunity from attack.
* A failed assassination attempt back-fires : If you guessed the wrong character on your opponent's roster, it will be published in the Chronicle that you made an attempt and failed, mentioning your house, the house you were targeting. The player you attacked receives a free piece of intel on you. A failed attempt reveals
    - The House which ordered the assassination
    - Two General pieces of intel on the other House
    - The assassin's affiliation
    - The assassin's prominence
    - The assassin's violence power

| power | damage  | success rate      | performance penalty |
|:-----:|:-------:|:-----------------:|:-------------------:|
| 1     | 100%    | 25%               | 50%                 |
| 2     | 25%     | 100%              | 25%                 |
| 3     | 50%     | 100%              | 0%                  |
| 4     | 75%     | 100%              | 25%                 |
| 5     | 100%    | 100%              | 50%                 |


### Popular Vote

Players can log in to the Ascension game with the Facebook account they signed up with. They may then vote for both the winner and the runner-up (i.e. top 2) in each [Award Category](#Award-Categories). Scoring is done each Saturday at 12:00 Hong Kong time. Votes and Missions which have not been cast will not be considered.

#### Scoring and Awarding Points

A winning vote counts for 20 points, a runner-up vote scores 8 points. Characters racks up points in each award category, but before they are awarded to the players who fielded them, the points are first modified by the character's health (lower health is a negative multiplier) and a player's character and award category bonuses (bonuses are positive multipliers). In sum, **Characters** _score_ points based on _votes_, **Players** are _awarded_ points based on their character's _score_, _health_ and _bonus multipliers_. A player's points across their characters are summed up which becomes their episode score. The sum of the episode scores after 10 episodes is the season score, which determines the winner.

#### Prominence Multiplier

Gaining points from your characters is subject to a 'prominence multiplier' - whatever score the character should have been awarded based on points scored, is further multiplied by $6 - chararcter.prominance$. This is to attempt to get characters to wield points in the same order of manitude regardless of their prominence in the world. E.g. if a top-tier (i.e. prominence power 5) characters scores 100 points, they will not have their score modified, $(6-5) * 100 = 100$ - the score stays the same. If, however, the lowest-tier (i.e. prominence power 1) character scores 20 points, that we render $(6-1) * 20 = 100$.

#### Voting for your own Characters

While it is possible to vote for characters on your own roster - smart move! you're basically awarding yourself points. Though, as votes are public record, it might send a strong signal your roster fielded this character, attracting unwanted, even murderous attention. The only exception to this rule are characters whom due to House Abilities are immune from attack. Your votes for these character will award you no additional points.
