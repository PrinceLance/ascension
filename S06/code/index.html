	          <p>Ascension is an online text-based game played alongside season 6 of HBO's Game of Thrones. You play by selecting your favourite characters, and having them compete in award categories of wit, damage, jockey, style and support. Points are awarded by fellow players whom cast votes each episode.</p>

			<p>It is similar to fantasy football, as you build up a roster of characters at the start of the season, and get points for their performance in each episode.</p>

			<p>In keeping with the Game of Thrones logic, you can also send your characters on diplomatic and murder missions; gathering intelligence or taking out characters from other player's rosters. But be careful! Failed attempts leave you exposed! Plot at your own peril...</p>

      <p>Instead of focusing on content creation and hard work, we have learned how to master the art of doing nothing by providing massive amounts of whitespace and generic content that can seem massive, monolithic and worth your attention.</p>

      <p>Yes I know you probably disregarded the earlier boasts as non-sequitor filler content, but its really true. It took years of gene splicing and combinatory DNA research, but our bananas can really dance.</p>
