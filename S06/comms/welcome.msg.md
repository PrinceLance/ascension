Ascendees! 

Welcome to the **XXXX League**! 

You can select your roster via [tijptjik.github.io/ascension/S06/code/](tijptjik.github.io/ascension/S06/code/) - Facebook Login Required, but won't post anything to FB.

Please select the House as it has been assigned here. Mistakes will be corrected ;)

| Player             | House                            |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|


**REMEMBER** : Prominence Power penalises the characters scoring potential! So don't just pick the heroes of the show! :)

Please select your characters before you watch the show ! Though it is possible that not everyone will have selected their characters before you watch your show, so I'm holding off on flipping the voting switch till everyone's on-board.

If you want to take notes on who you'd want to vote for, it's the top 2 characters in these categories:

* Wit - smartest or most piercing delivery of a line.
* Damage - physical and mental destruction, dealt or received.
* Jockey - most cunning manoeuvring to gain or secure the Iron Throne.
* Style - best look, appearance or use of props.
* Support - most helpful supporting character.

Sherin has kindly contributed the [bios of all the characters on the roster](https://github.com/tijptjik/ascension/blob/gh-pages/S06/character.bios.csv) so it becomes easier to know who's who.

Enjoy the show! And I'll be in touch again soon!

Let the games begin!
