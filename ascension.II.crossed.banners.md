# Ascension II : Crossed Banners

The fog of war descends on Westeros. 

## Game Summary

Ascension is played alongside season 6 of HBO's Game of Thrones. You play online by selecting your favourite characters, and having them compete in award categories of _wit_, _damage_, _style_, _grievance_ and _support_. Points are awarded by fellow players whom cast votes each episode. It is similar to fantasy football, as you build up a roster of characters at the start of the season, and get points for their performance in each episode. In keeping with the Game of Thrones logic, you can send your characters on diplomatic and assassination missions; gathering intelligence or taking out characters from other player's rosters. But be careful! Failed attempts leave you exposed! Plot at your own peril...

## Quick Start

1. **Sign Up**. Sign up at [ascension.type.hk](http://ascension.type.hk).
2. **Pick a house**. Houses boost the characters you pick from that house, and are public knowledge.
3. **Pick 7 characters for your roster**. Every episode your characters will compete for points in the award categories (wit, damage, style, grieance and support). Players all vote for the characters who are most deserving of points in each category, so pick your characters wisely. Basic strategy is available below.
4. **Watch the weekly episode**. Watch the episode within a week of it being aired
5. **Cast your weekly votes**. For each of the award categories, vote who most deserves the award that week.
6. **Initiate weekly missions**. Send one of your characters to gather intel, and/or assasinate characters from another roster.
7. **Leaderboard Update**. Leaderboard is updated with the weekly character points, and the results from the spy and murder missions.
